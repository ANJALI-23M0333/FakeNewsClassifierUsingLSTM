# FakeNewsClassifierUsingLSTM

Developed a Fake News Classifier using LSTM networks, achieving an accuracy of 91.15% by preprocessing text data and implementing one-hot encoding and embedding layers to transform textual data into dense vector representations.

Optimized sequence modeling for natural language processing tasks by implementing an LSTM-based architecture with embedded word vectors, enhancing the model's ability to capture temporal dependencies in text data.

Integrated advanced text preprocessing techniques including stemming, stopword removal, and padding sequences, contributing to the model's robustness and accuracy in binary classification tasks.
